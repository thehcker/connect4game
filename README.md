# Connect 4 Game
## As the above4connect image shows, I have broken up the application into several sections via function components
## The function components are later connected together using a class component(Game class)


## A component that represents a circle (lime green)
## A component that represents a grid cell (dark red)
## A component that represents a row of cells (teal)
## A component that represents the game board (red)
## A section that displays the game messages (blue)
## A section with a restart button ( green)
