# Connect 4 Game
## As the above4connect image shows, I have broken up the application into several sections via function components
## The function components are later connected together using a class component(Game class)

## Step 1: Breaking Up the application into components
A component that represents a circle (lime green)
A component that represents a grid cell (dark red)
A component that represents a row of cells (teal)
A component that represents the game board (red)
A section that displays the game messages (blue)
A section with a restart button ( green)

## Adding the game state
The state should keep track of everything the game needs to know to function
