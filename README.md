# Connect 4 Game
## As the above4connect image shows, I have broken up the application into several sections via function components
## The function components are later connected together using a class component(Game class)

## Step 1: Breaking Up the application into components
A component that represents a circle (lime green)
A component that represents a grid cell (dark red)
A component that represents a row of cells (teal)
A component that represents the game board (red)
A section that displays the game messages (blue)
A section with a restart button ( green)

## Step 2: Adding the game state
The state should keep track of everything the game needs to know to function

## Step 3: Passing State down
Here the cell states is passed down to the individual grid cells. A click event handler is also passed down to the grid cells. Later, the basic functionality to change a cell circle's color is implemented
